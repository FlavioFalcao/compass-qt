Compass v1.0
============

Compass is a Forum Nokia example application that teaches the use of a
traditional compass and allows the user to determine the bearing to the desired
location using Ovi maps. The main purpose of the example application is to
demonstrate the use of the Maps and Navigation API.

FILES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

bin/*

- Contains the compiled binaries.

src/arc.h

- Implements a custom QML element, Arc, that can draw an arc. Arc is used in
  the calibration view to represent the calibration level.

src/declarativeview.h / cpp

- Derives QDeclarativeView to handle multitouch events.

src/main.cpp

- Locks the orientation to portrait, creates the MainWindow object, and sets
  the MainWindow object to full screen.

src/mainwindow.h / cpp

- Creates the declarative intepreter, compass sensor / filter, orientation
  sensor / filter, and geo position information source. Connects the sensor's
  signals to QML functions and shows the QML UI.
  
src/orientationfilter.h

- Multiderives QObject and QOrientationFilter to allow emitting of Qt sinals
  when the orientation changes.
  
src/backup_registration.xml

- Describes the backup / restore logic on how to backup the application in
  Symbian OS.
  
src/qml/BorderDialog.qml

- Implements a dialog that has nice borders. The dialog also handles the
  orientation changes with animations.
  
src/qml/CalibrationView.qml

- Implements the calibration view, shows the compass scale and needle to
  indicate the calibration level, plays feedback effects, and shows the
  calibration completed dialog.

src/qml/Compass.qml

- Implements the compass with a compass plate, scale plate, and needle.
  Contains mouse areas to implement the rotation of the compass and the scale
  plate as well as moving the compass.
  
src/qml/InfoView.qml

- Uses BorderDialog.qml to show the information view.

src/qml/PannableMap.qml

- Implements the map that can be panned. Also shows the "you are here" circle
  on the map.
  
src/qml/setting.js

- Implements the logic to interact with SQLite DB to load / save the
  application settings.
  
src/qml/SettingsPane.qml

- Uses BorderDialog.qml to show the settings view. The ListModel is used to
  show the settings. The SQLite DB content is used as a data model for the
  view.
  
src/qml/Ui.qml

- The main QML element in this application. Creates all other elements and
  coordinates the interaction between elements.


KNOWN ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The walked route cannot be drawn on top of the map by using the MapPolyLine
  element. This feature will be implemented when QtMobility is mature enough to
  support it.

  
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mobile device (Symbian^3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to install the application on the device.

0. The Qt libraries (4.7.2 or higher) must be installed. See COMPATIBILITY for
   more information about the installation.

1. a) Drag the compass_v1_0_s^3.sis file to the Nokia Ovi Suite when the
      device is connected with the USB cable.
   
   OR
   
   b) Send the application directly to the Messaging Inbox (for example,
      through Bluetooth).

2. After the installation is complete, return to the Application menu and
   select the Applications folder.
   
3. Locate the Compass icon and select it to launch the application.


RUNNING THE APPLICATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The application has two modes: Compass mode and Map mode.

In the Map mode you can view the map with your current position
retrieved by GPS and indicated with a red circle. The radius of the red circle
changes according to the GPS fix accuracy. The more accurate the fix, the
smaller the circle; indicating your current location more precisely. The map
can be panned by dragging it with a finger. The zoom level can be changed by
pinching the map with two fingers. The GPS indicator in the upper left corner
will iterate when the phone is trying to retrieve the GPS fix. The indicator is
steady when the signal is received from the satellites. Tapping the GPS
indicator will pan the map to the current location.

To navigate to a certain position in a map:

1. Switch to the Map mode, place the edge of the compass on the map so that it
   connects the current location with the desired destination, and turn the
   scale of the compass to the grid north.

2. Switch back to the Compass mode and turn around with the phone until the
   compass needle is positioned on top of the outlined orientating arrow. The
   desired bearing is now in front of you.

   
The following on / off settings adjust the behavior of the application:

Auto north in the map:
    Automatically turn the scale of the compass to the grid north when the
    compass is rotated in the Map mode.

Bearing turnable in the Compass mode:
    The turnability of the bearing can be prevented in the Compass mode. By
    setting the turnability off you can prevent accidential touch events which
    would affect to the navigation in the field. When turnability is enabled,
    the compass application can be used with a real paper map.
    
Prevent screensaver:
    Prevents the screensaver from getting activated.

Satellite map:
    Toggles between the map and the satellite.

Use sound in calibration:
    Defines whether audio feedback is used during the calibration process.



COMPATIBILITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Symbian^3 with Qt version 4.7.2 or higher.

  1. Download Qt for Symbian (4.7.2 or higher) from qt.nokia.com.
  
  2. Drag qt_installer.sis on top of the device in Nokia Ovi Suite while the 
     device is connected. The SIS package is found in the installation folder 
     of Qt for Symbian (4.7.2 or higher).
