Compass v0.2
============

Compass is a Forum Nokia example that teaches the use of traditional compass
and allows the user to have a bearing to the desired place using the Ovi maps.
The main purpose of the example is to demonstrate use of Maps and navigation
API.

FILES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

main.cpp

- Locks the orientation to portrait, creates the MainWindow object and sets the
  MainWindow object to full screen.
  

KNOWN ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The walked path can not be drawn on top of the map by using MapPolyLine
  element. Feature will be implemented when the QtMobility is mature enought
  to support it.

  
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mobile device (Symbian^3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to install the application on the device.

0. The Qt libraries (4.7.2 or higher) must be installed. See the section 
   COMPATIBILITY for more information about the installation.

1. a) Drag the compass.sis file to the Nokia Ovi Suite when the device is 
      connected with the USB cable.
   
   OR
   
   b) Send the application directly to the Messaging Inbox (for example,
      through Bluetooth).

2. After the installation is complete, return to the Application menu and
   select the Applications folder.
   
3. Locate the Compass icon and select it to launch the application.


RUNNING THE APPLICATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The application consists two modes: Compass mode and Map mode.

In the Map mode you are able to view the map  with your current position
retrieved by GPS and shown with a red circle. The radius of the red circle will
change according to the GPS fix accuracy. The more accurate fix the more
smaller circle is shown giving you more precise location of you current
whereabout. The map can be panned by dragging the map with a finger. The zoom
level can be changed by pinching the map with two fingers.The GPS indicator on
the upper left corner will iterate when the phone is trying to retrieve the GPS
fix. The indicator is steady when the signal is received from the satellites.
Tapping the GPS indicator will pan the map to the current location.

To navigate to some position in a map do the following: First switch to the Map
mode, place the edge of the compass on the map so that it connects the current
location with the desired destination and turn the scale of the compass to the
map north. Now, enter to the Compass mode and turn with the phone as long as
the compass needle is positioned on top of the outlined orientating arrow. The
desired bearing is now at your front.

There exists couple of on / off type of settings that adjusts the behavior of
the application:

Auto north in map:
    Automatically turn the scale of the compass to the map north when compass
    is rotated in Map mode.

Bearing turnable in Compass mode:
    The turnability of the bearing can be prevented in the Compass mode. By
    setting the turnability off you can prevent accidential touches which would
    affect to the navigation in the field. Also by enabling the turnability the
    compass can be used with the real paper map.
    
Prevent screensaver:
    Prevents screensaver for occuring.

Satellite map:
    Toggles between map and satellite.

Use vibra in calibration:
    Sets if the haptic feedback is used on the calibration process.



COMPATIBILITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Symbian^3 with Qt version 4.7.2 or higher.

  1. Download Qt for Symbian (4.7.2 or higher) from qt.nokia.com.
